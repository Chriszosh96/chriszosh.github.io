I'm an Economics PhD student at Binghamton University studying topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory and Behavioral Economics. I focus on learning processes which can be applied both as models of decision-making (operationalized in agent-based simulations) and as robust methods for optimization and on the use of multi-agent simulation to investigate the implications of various boundedly-rational decision making processes.
