I'm an Economics PhD student at Binghamton University studying topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory and Behavioral Economics, with a focus on learning processes, applying them both as models of decision-making (operationalized in Agent-Based simulations) and as optimization techniques. I'm also interested in formalizing methodological practices for bringing computational models to data.
