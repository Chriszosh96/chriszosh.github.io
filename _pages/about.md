I'm an Economics PhD canidate at Binghamton University (SUNY) currently on the job market (2024 - 2025).

I study topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Behavioral Economics, with a focus on learning processes which can be applied both as models of decision-making (operationalized in agent-based simulations) and as robust methods for optimization and on the use of multi-agent simulation to investigate the implications of various boundedly-rational decision making processes.
