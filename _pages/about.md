I'm an Economics PhD student at Binghamton University studying topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory and Behavioral Economics. I focus on learning processes which can be applied both as models of decision-making (operationalized in Agent-Based simulations) and as flexible methods for optimization. I'm also interested in formalizing methodological practices for bringing computational models to data.
