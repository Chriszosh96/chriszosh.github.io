I am an Economics PhD student interested in Behavioral economics, Game theory, Decision theory and Complex systems. I specialize in developing computational simulations in which 
boundedly rational learning agents play games or aim to solve various complex problems and am very passionate about making such methods accessible to other researchers.

My current research agenda includes exploring the extent to which Ostrom's principles can emerge given various bottom-up and top-down policy formation rules
 and investigating how various models of agent learning serve as predictors of decision making in laboratory experiments.
