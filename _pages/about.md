I am an Economics PhD student interested in Behavioral economics, Game theory, Decision theory and Complex systems. I specialize in developing computational simulations in which 
boundedly rational learning agents play games or aim to solve various complex problems. I hope to both make such methods accessible to other researchers and to contribute to the existing
litterature on the role of such methods in Economics and how such methods can be brought to data in ways analogous to regression methods.

One present research agenda includes exploring the extent to which Ostrom's principles can emerge in adaptive models of resource games with top-down and bottom-up policy
formation mechanisms. Another involves exploring how simple models of agent learning fair as predictors of play in laboratory data.
