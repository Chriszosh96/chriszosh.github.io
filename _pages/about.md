I am an Economics PhD student interested in Behavioral economics, Game theory, Decision theory and Complex systems. I specialize in developing computational simulations in which 
boundedly rational learning agents play games or aim to solve various complex problems. I'm also very passionate about making such methods accessible to other researchers.

My current research agenda can be broken into two main components. First, investigating how various models of learning and decision making serve as predictors of decision making in laboratory experiments. 
Second, exploring the extent to which we can establish sufficient conditions for the emergence of Ostrom's principles of sustainable governance in adaptive, game-theoretic models of resource management.
