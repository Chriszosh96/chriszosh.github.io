I'm an Economics PhD canidate at Binghamton University (SUNY) currently on the job market (F2024 - S2025).<br>

I study topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Behavioral Economics, with a focus on the use of multi-agent simulation to investigate the often delicate relationships between how agents make decisions, how they interact with each other, and various model outcomes. I also make use of a variety of learning algorithms and stochastic optimization processes which can serve both as simple boundedly rational decision making processes and as fairly robust methods for optimization.<br>
