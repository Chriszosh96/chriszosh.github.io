I'm an Economics PhD canidate at Binghamton University (SUNY) currently on the job market (F2024 - S2025).

I study topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Behavioral Economics, with a focus on learning processes which can be applied both as models of decision-making (operationalized in agent-based simulations) and as robust methods for optimization. I also specialize in building multi-agent simulations (in python) to investigate the affect the often non-trivial effect interaction rules, institutions, and various boundedly-rational decision making processes can have on a system.
