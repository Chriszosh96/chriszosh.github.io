I'm an Economics PhD canidate at Binghamton University (SUNY) currently on the job market (F2024 - S2025).

I study topics in Decision Theory, Game Theory, and Behavioral Economics, with a focus on the use of multi-agent simulation to investigate the sometimes delicate relationship between model features / decision rules and their outcomes. I also often make use of various learning algorithms which can serve both as simple boundedly rational decision making processes or as fairly robust methods for optimization.
